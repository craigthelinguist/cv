\section{\sc Interests \& Projects}

{\bf Natural \& Programming Languages}. I'm interested in the structure of languages. This includes: compilers, programming language design, and natural language processing. I have made several corpora for M\=aori and NZ English. I have my own SAT solver that I've been tinkering with. At NZRS I did research into detecting botnets by classifying domain names. As part of that I gave a presentation at the 2015 New Zealand Internet Research Forum.

{\bf Visualisations.} At NZRS I helped verify data used to generate a map of the New Zealand internet. I have implemented several interactive algorithm visualisations (A*, Kruskal's, Knight's Tour, KNN).

{\bf Computer Science Education.} My work in computer science pedagogy keeps me sharp in a diverse number of areas. I am writing an introductory textbook of computer science, partly motivated by my experience as a student.

{\bf Game Development}. Each year I attend Pixeljam, a Wellington-based gamejam. We've several flavours of game, such as a 2d lane-runner, a 2d platformer, and a 3d horror game. Recently I started working on a 2d game engine in Java, built atop OpenGL.
