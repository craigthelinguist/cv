%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\bf Visualisations.} At NZRS I helped verify data used to generate a map of the New Zealand internet. I have implemented several interactive algorithm visualisations (A*, Kruskal's, Knight's Tour, KNN).

{\bf Computer Science Education}. Motivated by my experiences as a student and a tutor, I am writing an introductory "textbook" of computer science. It covers a wide range of subjects: low-level and high-level, mathematics, theory, application, philosophy. My opinion is that existing textbooks are too narrow in one area which leaves students with a poor understanding of the big picture.

\section{\sc Interests \& Projects}
{\bf Natural \& Programming Languages}. I'm interested in the logical structure of languages. This includes: compilers, programming language design, and natural language processing (NLP). I made several NLP utilities at NZRS. I've compiled several word and n-gram corpora for Maori and NZ English. I have my own SAT solver I've been tinkering with. At NZRS I did research into detecting botnets by classifying domain names. As part of that I gave a presentation at the 2015 New Zealand Internet Research Forum.

{\bf Game Development}.  I am working on a 2d game engine in Java, built atop OpenGL. I've worked on several other small games and attend Pixeljam (a Wellington-based gamejam contest) yearly.
